# My-python-programs
These are some of the programs I wrote for my classes while doing a Computer Science minor.

These include:
  - automating analysis and modification of texts
  - simulating card games & other games from gametheory
  - coding interactive games & graphical user interface to play the games

note: The tests get more complicated as the numbers increase

Modelling Evolution of Cooperation 						   
  - Created Python classes, and subclasses to define different players, their strategies, and
    the rules of the interactions, which is based on the game, Infinite Prisoner’s Dilemma.
  - Created structures with lists and dictionaries that each player can use to get information
    about their opponents’ past actions.
  - Defined functions to simulate thousands of interactions between players. In this
    simulation, the players that win more will leave more copies of themselves in the next
    generation, similar to biological evolution.
