# My-python-programs
These are some of the programs I wrote for my classes while doing a Computer Science minor.

These include:
  - automating analysis and modification of texts
  - simulating card games & other games from gametheory
  - coding interactive games & graphical user interface to play the games

note: The tests get more complicated as the numbers increase
